## Interaction Menu
### Register CEO: PgUp
**Notes:**
* This shortcut is designed to be used outside of your properties. While in some properties, the command will not execture properly because the interaction menu is different. If you use it inside and see it not work, just manually register to get back in sync with the script.
* If you are already registered as a CEO, this command will be ignored.
* If you are already registered as an MC, your MC will be disbanded and then you will be registered as a CEO. This should be rare as you should avoid being registered as an MC outside of your properties to avoid NPC attacks on your businesses.
