## Interaction Menu
### Register CEO: PgUp (Will register you as a CEO.)

**Notes:**
* This shortcut is designed to be used outside of your properties. While in some properties, the command will not execture properly because the interaction menu is different. If you use it inside and see it not work, just manually register to get back in sync with the script.
* If you are already registered as a CEO, this command will be ignored.
* If you are already registered as an MC, your MC will be disbanded and then you will be registered as a CEO. This should be rare as you should avoid being registered as an MC outside of your properties to avoid attacks on your properties.

### Register MC: PgDn (Will register you as an MC.)
**Notes:**
* This shortcut is designed to be used inside of your MC Businesses. This is because it is not recommended to be registered as an MC outside of your properties to avoid attacks on your properties.
* If you are already registered as an MC, this command will be ignored.
* If you are already registered as a CEO, your CEO will be disbanded and then you will be registered as an MC.
